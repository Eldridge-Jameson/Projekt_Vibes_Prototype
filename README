Projekt Vibes is a orthographic platformer. Appearing 2D but rendered in 3D, it was developed by myself, Japp Gulang, Jeremy Le, and Carlos Maldonado Lizardo for our senior capstone in Fall 2022.

I was project lead, as well as player developer and artist.
Japp was UI and general developer, and helped with the player's Blast ability.
Jeremy was the composer and sound designer.
Carlos was the level developer, and created all the hazards and obstacles.

It took us three months to create, and was worth every second of development. It was developed in the Godot engine.
